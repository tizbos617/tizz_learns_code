# tizz_learns_code
The beginning of a new journey!

A growing collection of Python challenges, experiments, and learning milestones
Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository documents my progress as I work through hands‑on challenges, build small applications, and strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts. Each file represents a step forward — from simple boolean logic to more structured, menu‑driven programs.
